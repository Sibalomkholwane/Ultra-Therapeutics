# Ultra-Therapeutics
UTC is engaged in the development of affordable and accessible precision oncology solutions , using advanced genomics and next-generation digital health technology, to personalize patient care in oncology. We have developed unique set of comprehensive genomic panels which allow oncologists to chose the optimal targeted therapies for their patients.

All our efforts are channeled towards accelerating oncology research and creating affordable yet state-of-the-art solutions for cancer patients aimed towards improving clinical outcomes. We are devoted to the study of evidence retrieved from real-world settings and to understand malignancies, medicaments, therapies and cures

Automating cancer prediction with high accuracy for efficient treatment, reduces resources and improves profit.

Problem Statement

For diagnosis, patients undergo a number of tests such as blood test , CT-scan , MRI , genetic testing etc. Artificial Intelligence can help in cancer imaging where a model can be trained on the images(CT scan or MRI etc) . Ultratheraputics wants to create a deep learning model which can predict if a person is having cancer from CT scan images. The dataset will be provided which contains three types of cancerous samples and normal samples. Objective is to create a classification model that identifies and classifies types of cancers.
